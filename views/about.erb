        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Aling Nena was born on May 11, 1929, in a small house in Tondo, Manila. Including her parents, they are seven in the family. Her father was a carpenter, while her mother was a housewife. However, at  age 5, her father was a victim of a hit and run accident in front of thier small house in Tondo. As a result, her mother decided to put up a sari-sari store. On the brink of World War II, the sari-sari store was forced to close down due to the war. When the war ended, her mother died due to starvation because all the food that she had, she gave it all to her children. Aling Nena decided to continue her mother's dream of opening a successful sari-sari store. </p>

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>After all the things that Aling Nena went through, her sari-sari store is the most popular sari-sari store in the whole metro. Unfortunately, her one and only daughter left the country and migrated to Canada. Her daughter reportedly tried to chase a guy who looks like a panda. Despite this, Aling Nena still continues to operate her sari-sari store. </p>
